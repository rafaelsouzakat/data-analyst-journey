-- Joins
-- they allow us to combine 2 tables or more together if they have a common column with similar data
-- we are going to see inner joins, outer joins and self joins

SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics;

SELECT *
FROM employee_salary;

-- Inner Joins: will return rows that are the same in both columns from both tables
SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics
INNER JOIN employee_salary
	ON employee_demographics.employee_id = employee_salary.employee_id;
    
SELECT dem.employee_id, age, occupation
FROM employee_demographics AS dem		# aliasing is used here
INNER JOIN employee_salary AS sal		# aliasing is used here
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
    

-- Outer Joins
-- for Outer Joins we have a right outer join and a left outer join
-- a left join is going to get everything from the left table and only return the matches from the right table
SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics AS dem		# the left table is the table on the FROM statement		
LEFT OUTER JOIN employee_salary AS sal		
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
    
SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics AS dem		# the left table is the table on the FROM statement		
RIGHT OUTER JOIN employee_salary AS sal		
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
    
-- Self Join
-- it is a join where you tie a table to itself

SELECT * 
FROM employee_salary AS emp1
JOIN employee_salary AS emp2
	ON emp1.employee_id + 1 = emp2.employee_id;
# a secret Santa for example

SELECT emp1.employee_id AS emp_santa,
emp1.first_name AS first_name_santa,
emp1.last_name AS last_name_santa,
emp2.employee_id AS emp_name,
emp2.first_name AS first_name_emp,
emp2.last_name AS last_name_emp
FROM employee_salary AS emp1
JOIN employee_salary AS emp2
	ON emp1.employee_id + 1 = emp2.employee_id;
    
    
-- Joining multiple tables together
-- this works if the tables have common columns between them
SELECT *
FROM employee_demographics AS dem		
INNER JOIN employee_salary AS sal		
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
INNER JOIN parks_departments AS pd
	ON sal.dept_id = pd.department_id;
    
SELECT *
FROM parks_departments;
# this is just a reference table
# it usually doesn't have duplicates
